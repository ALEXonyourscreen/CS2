# ALEXonyourscreen CS:GO Config

You probably made it here after checking out my observer system, [SCOPE](https://github.com/ALEXonyourscreen/SCOPE), so thanks for dropping in to see my actual game config! Most of you will absolutely hate it so hopefully you have a laugh, and maybe find a couple of things you can use to tweak your own `autoexec.cfg`.

## Installation

Download the source of this repo and drop `aoys.cfg` and the `/aoys` folder into `[csgo_install_dir] /csgo/cfg`.

Type `exec aoys` in the CS:GO console to run my configuration.

## Notable Features

> Weapon buy keybind layout

> Purchase nade binds while in spawn, switch to nade otherwise

> Modern FPS style viewmodel

> Volume and Radar zoom automation when crouching or walking

> Jumpthrow and bomb drop binds

> Single click weapon switching

> Quickswitch bind that can be held to keep knife out

> A few of my practice modes as single key binds
