# ALEXonyourscreen CS2 Config

You probably made it here after checking out my observer system, [SCOPE](https://github.com/ALEXonyourscreen/SCOPE), so thanks for dropping in to see my actual game config! Most of you will absolutely hate it so hopefully you have a laugh, and maybe find a couple of things you can use to tweak your own `autoexec.cfg`.

## Installation

Grab `aoys.cfg` from up above and drop it into `[cs2_install_dir] /game/csgo/cfg`.

Type `exec aoys` in the CS2 console to run my configuration.

## Notable Features

> Weapon buy keybind layout

> Purchase nade binds while in spawn, switch to nade otherwise

> Single click weapon switching on the mouse

> Quickswitch bind that can be held to keep knife out

> Automated recoil-follow crosshair that resets each spray and disables when using pistols
